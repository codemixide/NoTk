</head>
<body>
  <h1>Codemix No CustomTkinter (No CTK Mode)</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Codemix No CustomTkinter</strong> is a simplified version of the original Codemix IDE,
    crafted to run smoothly on older versions of Windows. While the main Codemix IDE 
    (available at <a href="https://codemixide.github.io" target="_blank">codemixide.github.io</a>) 
    is designed with <em>CustomTkinter</em> for modern systems like Windows 10 and 11, 
    this "No CTK" version uses only classic <strong>Tkinter</strong>, making it fully 
    compatible with systems like Windows Vista, 7, and 8.
  </p>

  <h2>Purpose and Background</h2>
  <p>
    Many developers working with legacy hardware or school systems lack access to modern
    tools due to system limitations. Codemix No CTK was built to address that need. 
    By removing dependencies on CustomTkinter, this version stays lightweight, fast, and 
    compatible with a much wider range of Windows versions. It uses standard Python 
    modules, including Tkinter, ensuring no extra installation is necessary.
  </p>

  <h2>Main Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully built with Tkinter â€” no external GUI libraries needed</li>
    <li>Tabbed interface for working on multiple files</li>
    <li>Run Python scripts directly inside the IDE</li>
    <li>Simple text editor with easy navigation</li>
    <li>Clean and clear layout, easy for beginners</li>
    <li>Portable executable file</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Compatibility</h2>
  <p>
    Codemix No CTK is designed to work on older systems. Although exact system requirements
    are not officially documented, it has been confirmed to run on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Windows Vista</li>
    <li>Windows 7</li>
    <li>Windows 8</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since it uses Python's built-in Tkinter module, it is expected to function on
    any system with Python 3.x and basic graphical support.
